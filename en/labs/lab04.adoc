== Introduction

The aim of this exercise is to practice the PE file structure, particularly the symbol import tables (Import Table) and the table of addresses of imported symbols (Import Address Table, IAT). The structures are described in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680313(v=vs.85).aspx[MSDN]. For a better understanding of them, it might be better to refer to one of the tutorials for writing Windows programs in assembler and/or cracking, for example https://web.archive.org/web/20190517161709/http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/pe-tut1.html[Iczelion's PE Tutorial 1: Overview of PE File Format] and https://web.archive.org/web/20190517161709/http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/pe-tut6.html[Iczelion's PE Tutorial 6: Import Table]. You can find more detailed information about the PE file format in a very nice  http://www.pelib.com/resources/luevel.txt[article by Bernd Luevelsmeyer].

All structures described below are defined in the `windows.h` header file.

== Finding the Import Address Table (IAT)

The `GetModuleHandle(NULL)` returns an `HMODULE` of the current process, which we can cast to the `PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER` structure.

[source,cpp]
----
HMODULE hPEFile = GetModuleHandle(NULL); // NULL means the current process
PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER pDosHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER) hPEFile;
----

The `+pDosHeader->e_lfanew+` field contains the relative virtual address (RVA) of the NT header `PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure relative to the beginning of the PE file (i.e. the base address returned by `GetModuleHandle`):

[source,cpp]
----
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS pNTHeaders = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)( ((BYTE*)pDosHeader) + pDosHeader->e_lfanew );
----

The `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure includes a field `+pNTHeaders->OptionalHeader+`. This field contains an array of data directories `DataDirectory`; each directory contains a field called `VirtualAddress` (an RVA from `pDosHeader`) and a field `Size` carrying its size in bytes. Two of these directories are critical for this tutorial:

* Import Table -- `+pNTHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT]+`
* Import Address Table -- `+pNTHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT]+`

== The Import Table

The Import Table points to an array of `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` structures.

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR {
  union {
    DWORD Characteristics;            // 0 for terminating null import descriptor
    DWORD OriginalFirstThunk;         // RVA to original unbound IAT (PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA)
  } DUMMYUNIONNAME;
  DWORD TimeDateStamp;                // 0 if not bound,
                                      // -1 if bound, and real date\time stamp
                                      //     in IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT (new BIND)
                                      // O.W. date/time stamp of DLL bound to (Old BIND)
  DWORD ForwarderChain;               // -1 if no forwarders
  DWORD Name;
  DWORD FirstThunk;                   // RVA to IAT (if bound this IAT has actual addresses)
} IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR;
----

In the above structure, we are particularly interested in the `Name` field, which contains an RVA to an ASCII string (i.e. the C `char *`) with name of the DLL from which this descriptor imports symbols, and then the `OriginalFirstThunk` field (and for the homework the `FirstThunk` field).

There are as many `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` structures in memory as there are DLLs this PE file links to. A pointer to the first (and the last -- lying after the structures) can be obtained:

[source,cpp]
----
PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR pImportDescriptor = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR)(((BYTE*)pDosHeader) + pNTHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].VirtualAddress);
PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR pImportDescriptorEnd = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR)(((BYTE*)pImportDescriptor) + pNTHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].Size);
----

The end of the array can also be recognized by the fact that the last valid element has the value of the `Characteristics` field set to `NULL`. A question: What if these two ways of determining the length are in conflict? Which test would let us determine which option takes priority (i.e., what the operating system does)?

The `OriginalFirstThunk` field contains an RVA of the beginning of the array of structures `IMAGE_THUNK_DATA`; we can determine the size of the array thanks to the fact that the array ends with an empty `IMAGE_THUNK_DATA` structure. This structure (`PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA`) is automatically mapped to one of the following structures, depending on whether this is a 32-bit or a 64-bit PE file:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 {
  union {
    ULONGLONG ForwarderString;  // PBYTE
    ULONGLONG Function;         // PDWORD
    ULONGLONG Ordinal;
    ULONGLONG AddressOfData;    // PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME
  } u1;
} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64;
typedef IMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 * PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64;

#include "poppack.h"                        // Back to 4 byte packing

typedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32 {
  union {
    DWORD ForwarderString;      // PBYTE
    DWORD Function;             // PDWORD
    DWORD Ordinal;
    DWORD AddressOfData;        // PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME
  } u1;
} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32;
typedef IMAGE_THUNK_DATA32 * PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA32;
----

The `AddressOfData` field *usually* indicates the RVA of the `IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME` structure, which is defined as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME {
  WORD    Hint;
  CHAR   Name[1];
} IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME, *PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME;
----

The `Hint` field contains information for the loader, the position where the symbol is likely to be found in the library in the Export Address Table (if the position does not match, the symbol is looked up by its name). The `Name` field contains an ASCIIZ string with the name of the imported symbol.

[TIP]
====
The `Name` field is declared with a size of 1 CHAR. This is a way of declaring that there will be a string of indeterminate length. Do not be afraid to access beyond the bounds of this structure. If you use `strcpy_s` with an appropriately sized buffer and you read from this field, everything will be fine.
====

[NOTE]
====
Why "usually"? Imported symbols may also be referred to by their ordinal number. In this case, the `AddressOfData` is of type `IMAGE_THUNK_DATA` and the highest bit of the item is set to 1 (which is how we can recognize this situation), and the remaining bits determine the order of the symbol in the library.
====

== Exercise for the Lab

Write a program that prints a list of DLLs it is linked against, and for each DLL a list of imported symbols. You do not need to deal with extreme conditions or UI, the purpose of this task is to get acquainted with the structure of IAT. We will need it in the following exercises. Your program does not have to do anything besides printing out a list of DLLs and symbols, but it would be wise to explicitly use API calls such as `CreateFileA` or `MessageBoxA` to ensure that some symbols are actually being imported. You can also check your result with the output of the Dependency Walker tool.

If you liked this assignment, find a relationship of the `Hint` field and the Export Address Table (Directory no. 0) of another module such as (`kernel32.dll`). You can get its `HMODULE` and `PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER` by calling e.g. `GetModuleHandle(TEXT("kernel32.dll"))`.

== Second homework

You can read the details of the second homework on a xref:../homeworks/iat.adoc[separate page].
