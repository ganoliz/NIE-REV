== Motivation

If a program uses identification of types at runtime (Run Time Type Identification, RTTI), such as when it is using the `typeid` or `dynamic_cast` operator, the program needs to contain information about class relationships and other information which can be effectively used in during its reverse engineering. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how virtual methods are called, how this relates to the virtual method tables, where and how are these tables stored, and how all of this corresponds to the type information in RTTI. We will extract a class name and inheritance information from RTTI metadata.

== Virtual Method Table

The virtual method table (Virtual Method Table, VMT) is present in all objects that have virtual methods. Each row of this table contains a pointer to the method or a pointer to the `_purecall` function (MSVC) if the method is not implemented and the class is abstract. In simple objects a VMT pointer is saved as the first item in the class/struct. The VMT address can be obtained as:

[source,cpp]
----
pVMT = *(void**)this;
----

[NOTE]
====
Of course, if an object is to have a VMT, it must be polymorphic (i.e. it must have virtual methods), otherwise the first item in the class contains the first data.
====

VMT is assigned in the constructor (ctor). If there's no constructor, a compiler provides an implicit constructor. The VMT is usually assigned as one of the last things a ctor does:

[listing]
----
(gdb) x/20i 'IUnknown::IUnknown()'
   0x400ac6 <IUnknown::IUnknown()>:     push   %rbp
   0x400ac7 <IUnknown::IUnknown()+1>:   mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x400aca <IUnknown::IUnknown()+4>:   mov    %rdi,-0x8(%rbp)  ; store the this pointer to a local var.
   0x400ace <IUnknown::IUnknown()+8>:   mov    -0x8(%rbp),%rax
   0x400ad2 <IUnknown::IUnknown()+12>:  movq   $0x400fd0,(%rax) ; VMT assignment
   0x400ad9 <IUnknown::IUnknown()+19>:  pop    %rbp
   0x400ada <IUnknown::IUnknown()+20>:  retq
----

If we list the VMT:

[listing]
----
(gdb) x/4a 0x400fd0
0x400fd0 <_ZTV8IUnknown+16>:
  0x4007d0 <__cxa_pure_virtual@plt>
  0x4007d0 <__cxa_pure_virtual@plt>
  0x4007d0 <__cxa_pure_virtual@plt>
  0x0
----

we obtain information that the studied class is an abstract class. That's correct: if we look at the declaration of the `IUnknown` class in the `unknwn.h` header file in the Windows SDK, we find that all methods in the class have =0 at the end and that means the method is pure virtual and thus the class is abstract. If we list VMT for another class deriving from `IUnknown` such as our class `CUnknown`:

[listing]
----
(gdb) x/4a 0x400f70
0x400f70 <_ZTV8CUnknown+16>:
  0x4007d0 <__cxa_pure_virtual@plt>
  0x4008f6 <CUnknown::AddRef()>
  0x400914 <CUnknown::Release()>
  0x0
----

we discover that the `CUnknown` class is also abstract, since it only overrides the `AddRef` and `Release` methods but leaves the `QueryInterface` method unimplemented. What use is this information? We have found that functions at addresses `004008f6` and `00400914` belong to the same class. With VMT, we can also identify the class: The VMT pointer is shared by all instances of the class. We would not know the class' name yet, if it weren't for the fact that the program was compiled in Debug mode and the debug information present in it tells us the class is named CUnknown; but we can find this information from RTTI even with no debugging information.

== Type Information

RTTI keeps information about types and their inheritance. Without RTTI it would not be possible to implement the `dynamic_cast` operator and cast from base class to derived classes. The type information is stored as the -1st (yes, -1) entry in the VMT:

[source,cpp]
----
pVMT = *(void**)this;
void* pTypeInfo = ((void**)pVMT)[-1];
----

The content of the type information depends on the compiler and its runtime. Lecture slides show this for the Microsoft C++ compiler where the basic type information `pTypeInfo` points to the `RTTICompleteObjectLocator` structure:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct _RTTICompleteObjectLocator
{
  DWORD signature;
  LONG offset;
  LONG cdOffset;
  TypeDescriptor * pTypeDescriptor;
  _RTTIClassHierarchyDescriptor * pClassHierarchyDescriptor;
} _RTTICompleteObjectLocator;
----

The `TypeDescriptor` field contains the class/struct name:

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct _RTTITypeDescriptor
{
  void* __vftbl; // Always points to the type_info's vftable
  void* data;
  char d_name[1]; // Mangled data type name
} _RTTITypeDescriptor, TypeDescriptor;
----

The `_RTTIClassHierarchyDescriptor` field contains information about inheritance of the class/struct.

[source,cpp]
----
typedef struct PMD
{
  ptrdiff_t mdisp; //vftable offset
  ptrdiff_t pdisp; //vftable offset
  ptrdiff_t vdisp; //vftable offset (for virtual base class)
};

typedef const struct _s_RTTIBaseClassDescriptor
{
  TypeDescriptor *pTypeDescriptor;
  DWORD numContainedBases;
  PMD where;
  DWORD attributes;
  _RTTIClassHierarchyDescriptor *pClassDescriptor;
} _RTTIBaseClassDescriptor;

typedef const struct _s_RTTIBaseClassArray
{
  _RTTIBaseClassDescriptor *pArrayOfBaseClassDescriptors[1]; // A variable sized array
} _RTTIBaseClassArray;

typedef const struct _s_RTTIClassHierarchyDescriptor
{
  DWORD signature;
  DWORD attributes;
  DWORD numBaseClasses;
  _RTTIBaseClassArray *pBaseClassArray;
} _RTTIClassHierarchyDescriptor;
----

== Practical excercise

Analyze the attached program and locate all class use in it. Identify the classes' virtual methods and by exploiting the type information stored in the files, name the classes and discover their hierarchy.

== Third Homework

* Points: *5*
* Deadline: *TBA*

Analyze the `Had.exe` ("Snake.exe") executable from archive link:{imagesdir}/du3.zip[du3.zip].

* Examine the program and find all object constructors and VMT assignments.
** List the actual addresses of the VMTs and constructors.
** Make sure that the functions you found are actually constructors!
* From VMTs discover the numbers of virtual methods for each class.
* Find those class names and the class hierarchy from the RTTI information.
* Describe the class hierarchy.
** You will find that the hierarchy is a bit strange. List the strange parts and explain what is their meaning and what is the cause of them. Your explanation does not have to be completely accurate (from the binary, you can't easily decide which of several causes was the real one), but it should be consistent with the observed facts.
* *Bonus:* Patch the program so that you have 1000 lives. *2 points*

[NOTE]
====
Snake has been compiled with optimizations. That leads to a loss or redirection of some information which has been directly accessible in the tutorial's executable. For example, the constructors have been inlined. Finding them may be somewhat more difficult - but not too much.
====

[TIP]
====
Some students encountered issues when running Snake in Virtual Box. It was caused by an incomplete emulation of DirectX in Virtual Box. Version 5.2 with Guest Additions installed and 2D and 3D acceleration enabled seems to be fully functional, though.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
I will be happy if you use tools to help you in this task, but you shouldn't submit just a tool's output. You should interpret the results of the tool and explain whether it matches what you would expect in a program of this type - even tools can contain errors and we need to be able to evaluate whether their results are reasonable.
