== Recommendations

Recommendations for reverse engineering will be demonstrated live.

== Free tools

* *API Monitor* -- a tool for monitoring API calls in a program. It is possible to observe individual functions or their groups. http://www.rohitab.com[Homepage].
* *CFF Explorer* -- a tool for PE file analysis and modification. https://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php[Homepage].
* *Dependency Walker* -- a tool for analysis of import and export tables, capable of performing both static and dynamic analysis. https://www.dependencywalker.com[Homepage].
* *ExeInfoPE* -- a compiler identification tool. http://www.exeinfo.xn.pl[Homepage].
* *Ghidra* -- a disassembler and decompiler by NSA. https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/[Homepage].
* *HxD* -- A hex editor capable of editing RAM or a raw disk. https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/[Homepage].
* *IDA Free* -- an interactive disassembler for reverse engineering. This version *does not* contain any decompiler, but is free for non-commercial purposes. https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml[Homepage].
* *Process Explorer* -- a tool for detailed process monitoring. A significantly extended replacement for Windows' Task Manager. https://technet.microsoft.com/cs-cz/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx[Homepage].
* *Process Hacker* -- another tool for detailed process monitoring. Similar to Process Explorer, but adds some nice extra features. https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/[Homepage]
* *Process Monitor* -- another process monitoring tool -- tracks accesses to files, registry keys, etc. https://technet.microsoft.com/cs-cz/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx[Homepage].
* *Regshot* -- a tool for making System Registry snapshots and comparing them. https://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/[Homepage].
* *Resource Hacker* -- a tool for study and modification of the `.rsrc` section in PE files. http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/[Homepage].
* *RetDec* -- a disassembler and decompiler by Avast. https://github.com/avast/retdec/releases[Homepage].
* *Strings* -- a tool for extraction of strings from a file. Good for the initial analysis. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897439.aspx[Homepage].
* *X64Dbg* -- a debugger for both 32 and 64-bit executables. https://x64dbg.com/[Homepage].

== Commercial tools

* *Hiew* -- a programmer's hex editor with a disassembler (including x64) and various functionality useful for reverse engineering. http://www.hiew.ru/[Homepage].
* *IDA Pro* -- an interactive disassembler for reverse engineering. Supports a wide range of architectures. There are plenty of plug-ins, including decompilers from x86, x64, ARM, ARM64, and PowerPC into C. Very expensive, but very powerful. https://www.hex-rays.com[Homepage].

== Additional resources

* *The Decompilation Wiki* -- information about available decompilers. https://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/DeCompilation[Homepage].

== First homework

* Points: *5*
* Deadline: *TBA*

The goal of this homework is to reverse engineer file link:{imagesdir}/du1.zip[du1.zip] and convince it to send an e-mail to the teacher. The program uses a configuration file, but the provided one is incorrect. By the time you finish analyzing the application, you will learn the correct structure and content of the configuration. Then create a file that will cause sending of a *polite* e-mail. If you make an error, an impolite e-mail might get sent -- but that is not considered a correct solution ;-).

After you've managed to send the correct e-mail, send the teacher your config file (packed into ZIP, so that any modification by e-mail servers or clients can be detected) along with a brief description of your work (how you got this file). The polite e-mail itself is not a solution of the homework, it's just a notification for you that you got it right.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify the `CrackMe01.exe` application.
