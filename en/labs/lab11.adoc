In this tutorial we will analyze the attached program which simply saves an image `picture.jpg` on the disk and then terminates.

During the analysis, we will discover that the program contains several anti-debugging protections. Among other things, the structure of the program changes during runtime, making the static analysis ineffective. The goal of this exercise is to discover how the protections work and then modify the program in such a way as to save a different image from the resources section. To start with, it's acceptable to do it in the debugger, but eventually we should be able to modify the .exe file so that it always saves the alternative image.

[NOTE]
====
The analyzed application creates a part of its code during runtime. Unfortunately it does not mark the memory as executable. For this reason it requires that DEP (Data Execution Prevention) be turned off in the operating system; you can do that by running `systempropertiesadvanced.exe`, going to the `Advanced` tab, clicking on the `Settings` button in the `Performance` section`, and then in the new window on the `Data Execution Prevention` tab you can either "Turn off DEP for essential Windows programs and services only" or add the application to the exception list. The second option is more secure and does not require reboot, which makes it the preferred one.

== More anti-debugging techniques

Return to the second task of the xref:lab09.adoc[Advanced obfuscations tutorial]. Deobfuscate the code and identify the different anti-debugging techniques used.

== Enabling the patch menu in IDA Free

You can perform changes to the program directly inside IDA Free. The patch menu is hidden by default in version 5.0. It is possible to show it but you'll need to change the configuration file located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\IDA Free\cfg\idagui.cfg`. Open the file as the Administrator and change the `ENABLE_PATCH_SUBMENU=NO` line into `ENABLE_PATCH_SUBMENU=YES`. Save and (re)launch IDA Free. Then you will find the Patch submenu in the Edit menu.
