All external lecturers have confirmed their availability, which means the lecture and tutorial plan should be final (baring unforeseen circumstances).

Please note that the Jan Rubín lecture (December 4th) will be live only, i.e. it won't be either streamed or recorded. Please allow for that in your plans so that you can attend it physically. It's worth it.

Course materials updated for the upcoming semester.

Several aspects are not definitely established yet and are likely to change. However, I do not want to delay publishing the other, definitive information, because of them.

- The precise date of xref:labs/lab12.adoc[Martin Jirkal's 12th tutorial] is yet to be established.
- The xref:projects/keygen.adoc[Keygen semestral work] will probably undergo a complete rewrite to overcome its compatibility issues.
